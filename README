CDSChecker Readme
****************************************

This is an evaluation-only version of CDSChecker. Please do not distribute.

CDSChecker compiles as a dynamically-linked shared library by simply running
'make'. It should compile on Linux and Mac OSX, and has been tested with LLVM
(clang/clang++) and GCC.

Test programs should use the standard C11/C++11 library headers
(<atomic>/<stdatomic.h>, <mutex>, <condition_variable>, <thread.h>) and must
name their main routine as user_main(int, char**) rather than main(int, char**).
We only support C11 thread syntax (thrd_t, etc. from <thread.h>).

Test programs may also use our included happens-before race detector by
including <librace.h> and utilizing the appropriate functions
(store_{8,16,32,64}() and load_{8,16,32,64}()) for loading/storing data from/to
from non-atomic shared memory.

Test programs should be compiled against our shared library (libmodel.so) using
the headers in the include/ directory. Then the shared library must be made
available to the dynamic linker, using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable, for instance.

Sample run instructions:

$ make
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
$ ./test/userprog.o                   # Runs simple test program
$ ./test/userprog.o -h                # Prints help information
Usage: <program name> [MC_OPTIONS] -- [PROGRAM ARGUMENTS]

Options:
-h                    Display this help message and exit
-m                    Maximum times a thread can read from the same write
                      while other writes exist. Default: 0
-M                    Maximum number of future values that can be sent to
                      the same read. Default: 0
-s                    Maximum actions that the model checker will wait for
                      a write from the future past the expected number of
                      actions. Default: 100
-S                    Future value expiration sloppiness. Default: 10
-f                    Specify a fairness window in which actions that are
                      enabled sufficiently many times should receive
                      priority for execution. Default: 0
-e                    Enabled count. Default: 1
-b                    Upper length bound. Default: 0
--                    Program arguments follow.


Note that we also provide a series of benchmarks (distributed separately),
which can be placed under the benchmarks/ directory. After building CDSChecker,
you can build and run the benchmarks as follows:

  cd benchmarks
  make
  ./run.sh barrier/barrier -f 10 -m 2  # runs barrier test with fairness/memory liveness
  ./bench.sh <dir>                     # run all benchmarks twice, with timing results; all logged to <dir>
